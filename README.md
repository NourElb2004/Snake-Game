# Snake Game

This project is an implementation of the classic Snake game as a desktop application. The player controls a snake that moves continuously, grows when it consumes food, and loses when it collides with the walls or itself.

The project focuses on real-time input handling, game loop control, collision detection, and state management.

## Features
- Keyboard-controlled snake movement
- Dynamic growth mechanism
- Collision detection
- Score tracking
- Game over handling

## Structure
- Source code is located in the `src` directory
- Compiled output is located in the `out` directory

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of interactive application development and basic game logic.
